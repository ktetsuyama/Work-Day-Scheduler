## Introduction

I would like a quiz to help sharpen my Javascript knowledge.

## Problem

I would like a fun way to solidify my knowledge of Javascript. Gamifying learning is an effective way to learn and keep an interest in the subject matter.

## Solution

I created a game using Javascript that asks a series of questions, informs me if the answer I chose was correct or incorrect, and allows me to save my highscore.

## Credits

I collaborated with George Schultz and John Young to troubleshoot any bugs that I had during development of this application. George helped me understand how to put the questions, choices, and answers in an array that can be queried within my game code. John Young helped me understand the code that renders the question on screen and renders the answer buttons. I also used phind.com to help debug my code.
