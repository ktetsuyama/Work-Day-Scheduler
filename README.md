## Introduction

The client has asked for a daily planner for a 9-5 workday.

## Problem

The client would like to be able to see a schedule of their day and make events, or "to-dos". The client would also like some color coding to quickly see what the current hour is and which hours are in the past and which are upcoming.

## Solution

I created a daily planner which shows the current hour highlighted in one color, then past hours in a second color, and future hours in a third color. The planner also allows for saving things as events in each hour timeslot.
